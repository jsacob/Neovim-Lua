git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim\
 ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/packer/start/packer.nvim


 also some nvim commands


small binds I want to remember.

K to check the signature

gd It takes you to the definition of the symbol under the curso rvery useful when you're navigating code and want to quickly jump to where something is defined.

:ls to list opened buffers, you can then :b<buffer num>

CTRL-w to jump between windows quickly but use CTRL-[h,j,k,l] to selectivly go through
^best used when only using two windows
CTRL-v to split vertical 
CTRL-s to split horizontal

qq to record
Q+SHIFT+:to view history

use ]d or [d to go to the next diagnostic

also when on a path you can shift+e to jump to the end of that file

f + charter to jump to, helpful for partheses of specifics i guess

cib jumps directly into and clearing the partheses
